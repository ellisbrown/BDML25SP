# LLaMA Fine-Tuning with Memory Optimizations

This repository contains the code and documentation for fine-tuning the LLaMA 3B model on climate documents using various memory optimization techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to fine-tune the LLaMA 3B model on a dataset of climate documents (IPCC reports and climate change/AI publications) while maximizing the batch size through memory optimization techniques.

## Memory Optimization Strategies

The following memory optimization techniques have been implemented:

### 1. Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

LoRA reduces memory usage by adding small trainable low-rank matrices to transformer layers instead of fine-tuning all model parameters:

- **Rank (r)**: Set to 8, determining the dimension of the low-rank matrices
- **Alpha**: Set to 32, controlling the scaling of the LoRA parameters
- **Target Modules**: Applied to query, key, value, and output projection matrices in attention layers
- **Trainable Parameters**: Reduced from billions to just a few million (< 1% of original model)

### 2. Quantization (QLoRA)

4-bit quantization dramatically reduces the memory footprint:

- **4-bit Load**: Model weights are loaded in 4-bit precision instead of 16/32-bit
- **Compute Type**: Calculations are performed in FP16 for stability
- **Double Quantization**: Applied to further reduce memory usage
- **NF4 Type**: Using the normalized float 4-bit quantization format

### 3. Mixed Precision Training

- **FP16 Training**: Using half-precision floating point for both activations and gradients

### 4. Gradient Accumulation and Checkpointing

- **Gradient Accumulation**: Accumulating gradients over multiple forward passes before updating model parameters
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trading compute for memory by recomputing activations during backward pass instead of storing them

### 5. 8-bit Optimizer

- **8-bit Adam**: Using quantized optimizer states to reduce memory usage

## Maximum Batch Size Achieved

Through binary search optimization, the maximum batch size achieved was **[INSERT FINAL BATCH SIZE]** with a gradient accumulation of **[INSERT GRAD ACCUM STEPS]**, giving an effective batch size of **[INSERT EFFECTIVE BATCH SIZE]**.

## Perplexity Results

The final perplexity on the test set: **[INSERT FINAL PERPLEXITY]**

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets peft tqdm bitsandbytes accelerate PyPDF2
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Prepare the data directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./extracted_texts
   ```

3. **Run the training script**:
   ```bash
   python llm_fine_tuning.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Extract text from PDFs
   - Split the data into training and test sets
   - Configure the model with memory optimizations
   - Find the maximum batch size
   - Train the model with the optimal batch size
   - Evaluate the model using perplexity

4. **Monitoring training**:
   The script outputs logs to the console showing:
   - Current batch size being tested
   - Training progress
   - Memory usage statistics
   - Final perplexity score

## Code Structure

- `llm_fine_tuning.py`: Main script containing the entire fine-tuning pipeline
- `extracted_texts/`: Directory containing the extracted text from PDFs
- `llama-finetuned/`: Output directory for the fine-tuned model and checkpoints

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully fine-tunes the LLaMA 3B model on climate documents with optimized memory usage. By combining LoRA, 4-bit quantization, mixed precision training, gradient accumulation/checkpointing, and 8-bit optimizers, we achieved a significant increase in batch size compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.
